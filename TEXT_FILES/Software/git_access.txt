GitHub stopped supporting basic authentication!!
need token or somehting else!!!
DONE to research!!! ASAP

#generate keys:
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "alex.gordon.gbs@gmail.com"
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "alex.gordon.gbs@gmail.com"

  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

#install GitHub CLI:
brew install gh

ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa

#add public key to your GitHub account
gh ssh-key add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

    -from terminal
    -in SourceTree 
    -in IntelliJ 

CONCLUSION
The GitHub, Git CLI and Mac do support the new format of the public/private key:
gh ssh-key add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
however the SourceTre does NOT support the new format.
Therefore I use older format id_rsa which is supported everywhere!!!
