Using Windows PowerShell...

cd to the folder - the bin of your Postgre installation:
C:\developer\tools\postgre\pgsql\bin

init the DB:
./initdb -D c:\Users\gordona\pgdata -U postgres -W -E UTF8 -A scram-sha-256
superuser name: postgres
password for the super user: alex

To start Postgres:
./pg_ctl -D c:\Users\gordona\pgdata start

To stop Postgres:
./pg_ctl -D c:\Users\gordona\pgdata stop

When the server started --> go to the folder:
C:\developer\tools\postgre\pgsql\pgAdmin 4\bin
and start the program:
pgAdmin4.exe = admin tool - browser based
I will have to create a server, point to your LOCAL server running, use your superuser for now
and its password - you created in the init step above.

Then go to Query Runner tab:
type this SQL
select * FROM pg_class
...and run it.
You are using PostreSQL locally!
